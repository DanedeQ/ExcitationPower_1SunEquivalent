## Calculate the Laser Power Density (mW/cm2) Needed to Match the Absorbed Photon Flux Under AM1.5 (1 Sun - 100 mW/cm2) Excitation Conditions for a Thin Film Semiconductor (i.e. Perovskites)

## Overview

This code is used to calculate the laser excitation power density (for a continuous wave source) needed to match the absorbed photon flux achieved under 1-Sun illumination. The user needs to input the absorption coefficient data as a function of wavelength of their semiconducting thin film along with the film thickness. The absorption coefficient data from a standard methylammonium lead halide perovskite thin film is used as an example. Laser power density for common lasers are 532 nm (Nd:YAG frequency doubled) - 60 mW/cm2; 488 nm (Argon) - 66 mW/cm2; 632.8 nm (He-Ne) - 51 mW/cm2.
