## Calculate the Laser Power Needed to Match to Absorbed Photon Flux Under AM1.5 (1 Sun) Excitation Conditions for a Thin Film Semiconductor (i.e. Perovskites)

## Overview

This code is used to calculate the laser excitation power (for a continuous wave source) needed to match the absorbed photon flux achieved under 1-Sun illumination. The user needs to input the absorption coefficient data as a function of wavelength of their semiconducting thin film along with the film thickness. The absorption coefficient data from a standard methylammonium lead halide perovskite thin film is used as an example.
